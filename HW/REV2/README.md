# xyphro UsbGpib Hardware REV 2

The new hardware revision picks up some things that I and others disliked:
- The REV 1 HW - when being assembled into its housing could collide with parts of the instrument's body. Especially for Keysight equipment. This new HW revision follows the form factor of an original GPIB cable to get rid of this mechanical constraint.
- The REV 1 HW required entering the bootloader using a tweezer. REV 2 has a button. Hold it a few seconds and the bootloader is entered.

The [software](../../SW) will always stay the same, no matter whether you have REV 1 or REV 2 hardware.

I have built many of those adapters myself so far and have developed trust in the design:

## Assembly process

All files related to the hardware are located in this folder, including Gerber files, BOM, and KiCAD design files.

### Preparing the PCB

Mount only the SMD components. This means: DON'T mount the GPIB connector yet.

On edge you can find a mounting point for a pinheader - 45 degrees angled. Mount 2-3 pin pinheaders here and you now have a 6 pin ISP programming port with standard pinout for your favorite AVR programmer. You can use a 2x3 pin header if you bend the bottom legs inward a bit on one side.
Program the bootloader. Pin 1 is marked on the PCB to allow you connecting the ISP cable in the correct orientation.

### Flashing the Microcontroller the first time

For initial programming an AVR ISP adapter is needed to program the `Bootloader.hex` file.

It is very important that the Fuses of the AVR are programmed.

Here an example of how to program the bootloader using avrdude (using a `usbasp` programmer; replace `usbasp` with the type of your programmer):
```
avrdude -c usbasp -p m32u4 -e -Ulock:w:0xFF:m -Uefuse:w:0xcb:m -Uhfuse:w:0xd8:m -Ulfuse:w:0xde:m
avrdude -c usbasp -p m32u4 -U flash:w:BootLoader.hex
```

To program the bootloader and application images at the same time using AvrDude, you can use this command:
```
avrdude -c usbasp -p m32u4 -e -Ulock:w:0x3F:m -Uefuse:w:0xcb:m -Uhfuse:w:0xd8:m -Ulfuse:w:0xde:m -U flash:w:TestAndMeasurement.hex -U flash:w:BootLoader.hex
```

Note, that some programmers use a quite high clock frequency on the programming interface. In case of failures try to decrease the SCK clock frequency!

After programming the file, disconnect and connect the device and a USB drive will show up. Copy the `TestAndMeasurement.bin` file to this USB drive - ideally using the command line.
#### Windows:
```
copy TestAndMeasurement.bin F:\FLASH.BIN
```
#### Linux:
On Linux, there is a bug with the LUFA mass storage that means it is required to use 
```
dd if=TestAndMeasurement.bin of=/mnt/FLASH.BIN bs=512 conv=notrunc oflag=direct,sync
```
#### Mac OS:
On MacOS you can use 
```
cp TestAndMeasurement.bin /Volumes/GPIBUSBBOOT/FLASH.BIN
```

When done, disconnect USB.

It is now safe to desolder the ISP pinheaders such that the PCB fits into the housing. 
Any further update can happen over USB using the bootloader.

## Building the whole thing together
Preparation:
- Mount the PCB EXCLUDING the GPIB connector.
- Print the housings located in [this folder](../../Housing/Rev2). I print them using 1mm bottom/top/wall thickness, 0.16mm layer height and 30% infill. On my K1 printer it takes 23 minutes to print, on my Ender 5 2.2 hours.
- get 2x 20mm M3 screws and 2x M3 nuts
- get a Centronics (GPIB) connector "24P Male solder type" from e.g. Aliexpress (DigiKey # 1024PMA-ND)

If you have everything in place and prepared, insert the PCB including the GPIB connector (unsoldered!) into the bigger part of the housing:

Then solder 2 pins of the GPIB connector and take the PCB out of the housing again to solder all pins.
(This step is required to ensure that the GPIB connector has the right distance to the PCB and fits into the housing)

As a next step insert the PCB into the big part of the housing again. It has a relatively tight fit - to ensure mechanical stability.

Then put the smaller part of the housing on top of it, inserting the screws (they can be pushed hard to destroy the "membrane" first time) and nuts, then screw it together.

Voil√†... your adapter is finished and ready to use :-)

# Updating the firmware at later stages

To enter the boot loader at later stages for updates, press the button (bigger hole in the housing) using a pen/paperclip for about 3 seconds. Then a USB mass storage (flash drive) will enumerate on the PC where the firmware image can be copied to (see previous chapter).
