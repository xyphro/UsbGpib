# Tutorials

I am busy creating several tutorials starting first with basic first bringup instructions for different operating systems. Those instructions are mostly for new users in the Test & Measurement domain and might be too excessive for more experienced users.

In case you have ideas/demands for certain topics to be turned into tutorials, feel free to contact me: Xyphro@gmail.com

The documentation is now provided in Markdown, with an option to view the corresponding PDF version directly from each page. After opening any of the links below, you can download the PDF using the download button in the top‑right corner.
