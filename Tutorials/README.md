# Tutorials

I am busy creating several tutorials starting first with basic first bringup instructions for different operating systems. Those instructions are mostly for new users in the Test & Measurement domain and might be too excessive for more experienced users.

In case you have ideas/demands for certain topics to be turned into tutorials, feel free to contact me: Xyphro@gmail.com

The documentation is in PDF format. You can download the PDF file by clicking the top right download button, after you clicked a link below.
